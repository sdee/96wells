# 96wells

The goal of this project is to automate the placement of samples on 96 well plates<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. Samples can be loaded as a list. Then, layouts can be applied to optimize for constraints such as samples being ordered by time points or samples being spaced out to avoid contamination. 

The code is designed to be modular so that custom layouts can be easily added. 

This is a work in progress and currently exists as a proof concept for combining d3, redux, and react.
